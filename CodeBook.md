#**Code Book**

The Code Book contains information about the data and how the data is manipulated.  
##Variables

##**Data**
 
The data was collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S Smartphone and is retrieved from the following link: 
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 
The files of interest are text files with data about subject, activity and features, named subject, y, x correspondingly. The names of the data are stored in two additional files, named activity_labels.txt and features.txt.
 
##**Manipulation**
 
The data is manipulated according to the following instructions:
* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
* Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
