## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
plot(cars)
```

My First R Markdown File 
========================

This is my first R markdown file.

Here, we're going to load some data.

```{r}
library(datasets)
data(airquality)
summary(airquality)
```

Let's first make a pairs plot of the data. 

```{r}
pairs(airquality)
```

Here's a regression model of ozone on wind, solar radiation, and temperature.

```{r}
library(stats)
fit <- lm(Ozone ~ Wind + Solar.R + Temp, data = airquality)
summary(fit)
```


Here's an unordered list:
